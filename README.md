## Implemenations of "Extra credit" objectives
Check out the other branches for the implementations of the following extra project objectives:
- "Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction."
- "Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions."
